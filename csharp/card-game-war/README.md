The rules of this card game are quite simple.

- There are two players.
- The cards are all dealt equally to each player.
- Each round, player 1 lays a card down face up at the same time that
  player 2 lays a card down face up.  Whoever has the highest value
  card, wins both round and takes both cards.
- The winning cards are added to the bottom of the winners deck.
- Aces are high.
- If both cards are of equal value - three cards are dealt from each hand face down and then 1 more face up to war again. the winner takes all the cards. If this ties repeat the process again.
- The player that runs out of cards loses.
